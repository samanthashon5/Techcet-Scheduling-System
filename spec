Problem statement:	
	
1	Setting up a Schedule/ Plan for Retention meetings is Labor intensive
2	Human error in setting up too many meetings in a single week or month on different or similar topics
3	Can we automate the process of setting/planning meeting dates such that
	A. the meetings are 3 months or more from the expiration date
	B. set up no more than 2 meetings per subject per week (each subject requires a different analyst)
	C. set up no more than 5-6 meetings in a single week (for all meetings both Christine and John S. must attend)
	D. no more than 2 meetings/week for a single customer
	E. need to give the customer 3 options for meeting times to choose from 
Notes:   1	Each meeting  is 1 hour
2	DSS members get 4 meetings per subject; CMC members get 1 meeting per subject
3	note that some customer have more than 1 subject topic that is included for those customers it is best to try and cover 2 topics in 1 meeting (30 min per topic)
